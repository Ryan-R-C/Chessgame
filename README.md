## Code Structure and Main Components

The project is organized as follows:

- **src/components/**
  - `Board.tsx`: Renders the board, pieces, and highlights valid moves.
  - `Game.tsx`: Handles the main game state, turn logic, piece selection, and victory detection.
  - `BoardSetup.tsx`: Lets the user choose the board size (between 6x6 and 12x12) and initializes the pieces in the correct positions.
  - `VictoryModal.tsx`: Modal displayed at the end of the game, showing the winner and options to restart or return home.
  - `gameUtils.ts`: Utility functions for identifying piece type and color.

- **src/game/**
  - `boardLogic.ts`: Implements the movement rules for each piece (Developer, Designer, Product Owner) and helper functions for game logic.

- **src/app/**
  - `page.tsx`: Main entry point of the application. Manages the display of the board setup and the game itself.

- **src/assets/**
  - `button.css`: Custom button styles.

---

## How the Code Works

- The user defines the board size on the initial screen.
- Pieces are automatically positioned according to the rules.
- The `Game` component manages all gameplay logic, including turn switching and move validation.
- The board is rendered by the `Board` component, which also highlights valid moves and selected pieces.
- When a player captures the opponent's Product Owner, the victory modal is displayed.
